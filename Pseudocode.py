# This pseudocode describes a process for iteratively removing the least important features from a dataset 
# based on feature importances calculated by a model explanation method (SHAP, LIME, CitrusX). 
# The aim is to evaluate the stability of feature importance rankings as features are removed and the model is retrained.
# The process involves retraining a machine learning model iteratively after removing the least significant feature 
# and calculating the consistency of feature importance rankings across iterations.


# Initialize:
# Model: A trained machine learning model
# Data: Dataset used for generating explanations
# ExplanationMethod: Method used for generating explanations (SHAP, LIME, CitrusX)
# MinFeatures: Minimum number of features to retain

# Function to compute and aggregate feature importances using a specified explanation method

    # Compute explanations for the entire dataset using the specified method
    # Aggregate explanations to derive feature importances
    # Return the aggregated feature importances

# Function to calculate the consistency of feature importances across iterations

    # Return the consistency score
    return consistency_score

def RemoveLeastSignificantFeature(Data, FeatureImportances):
    # Identify the feature with the least importance
    # Remove this feature from the dataset
    # Return the modified dataset

# Function to retrain the model using the modified dataset

    # Retrain the model based on the modified dataset
    # Return the updated model
